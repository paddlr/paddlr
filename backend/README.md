## API docs

Each of these API endpoints are illustrated by a curl command that you can paste into your terminal to play around with.

If you ever need more information, pass the `-v` flag to curl in addition to the stated arguments. This will put it into verbose mode, and will show you the HTTP response code and other useful debugging information.
